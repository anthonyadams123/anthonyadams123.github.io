    <h1> Anthony Adams </h1> 
    <h2> BLACK OPS </h2>
    <p>Student of the Month for 3 classes Anthony Adams has often used his voice to sing and talk .The boy becomes brave with his courage. He lost the chorus with 2018 voice of the month: A Confession, which he says alot “Ninja Sucks” traveling from Coney Island to East New York and becoming the BEST with a big mouth possibly the first time a 602 singer has made himself into a soloist singer twice over. The brave Anthony and one of his classmates doubles both suffered a nervous reaction of singing in a crowd as a result of a bad singing band to a drummer; Adams loves singings, mouth likely talks alot, that his voice of singing was not a work of drumming,that it was in his best interests to say so. He is also the best student to do any computer-like presentations. He even has his own 3 game consoles.</p>
